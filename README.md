### Project Description
We offer a **smartwatch-integrated digital wallet** designed for children, managed by their parents for secure and controlled spending. Parents can configure the wallet through a web platform, preloading funds and selecting approved stores or UPIDs for their children to shop at. This system ensures kids can make cashless payments effortlessly while parents maintain full transparency and control over transactions.

### The Problem statement
Modern parents face challenges in managing their children's payments due to time constraints, lack of real-time visibility into spending, and the inefficiencies of cash handling. There is a need for a solution that empowers children to make secure, independent payments while providing parents with automated monitoring and control to ensure safety and accountability. Such a system should be intuitive for kids, minimize parental involvement in routine transactions, and support local merchants for seamless adoption.

### The Solution
Our solution is a **digital wallet tailored for children**, managed seamlessly by their parents through a smart, intuitive system. The core innovation is a **smartwatch-integrated payment app** that allows children to make secure, cashless payments. Parents can log in to our web platform to configure the wallet, preloading funds and setting permissions by selecting specific stores or UPIDs where their children are allowed to shop. This ensures spending is controlled and restricted to trusted merchants. The smartwatch app makes transactions effortless for kids, with a simple tap-to-pay mechanism or QR code functionality. Real-time notifications and detailed spending summaries provide parents with full transparency, eliminating the need for constant monitoring while empowering children with financial independence in a secure and convenient way.
